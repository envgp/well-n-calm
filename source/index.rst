well-n-calm
===========

The well-n-calm is a resource to guide archiving various well data related to groundwater problems in California.
Currently, it is focused to provide a consistent format to organize compiled well data
in Envrionmental Geophysics group at Stanford. We share our lessons learned to compile well data
in our group for past 5 years while solving groundwater problems in California.
List of major projects incuding well data are:

- Butte
- Kaweah (Tulare)
- Indian Wells Valley
- San Louis Obispo

With the organization of well data in these projects, we also develop a basic python code base such that
one can easily explore the existing data sets, import new data, and export the data sets to various formats (e.g. LAS, CSV).
